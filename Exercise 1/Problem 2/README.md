Your next task is to complete the code in the file computeCost.m, which
is a function that computes J(θ). As you are doing this, remember that the
variables X and y are not scalar values, but matrices whose rows represent
the examples from the training set.
Once you have completed the function, the next step in ex1.m will run
computeCost once using θ initialized to zeros, and you will see the cost
printed to the screen.
You should expect to see a cost of 32.07.
