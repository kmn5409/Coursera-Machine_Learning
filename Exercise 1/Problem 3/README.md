Next, you will implement gradient descent in the file gradientDescent.m.
The loop structure has been written for you, and you only need to supply
the updates to θ within each iteration.
As you program, make sure you understand what you are trying to optimize
and what is being updated. Keep in mind that the cost J(θ) is parameterized
by the vector θ, not X and y. That is, we minimize the value of J(θ)
by changing the values of the vector θ, not by changing X or y. Refer to the
equations in this handout and to the video lectures if you are uncertain.
