Your first step is to implement this function in sigmoid.m so it can be
called by the rest of your program. When you are finished, try testing a few
values by calling sigmoid(x) at the Octave/MATLAB command line. For
large positive values of x, the sigmoid should be close to 1, while for large
negative values, the sigmoid should be close to 0. Evaluating sigmoid(0)
should give you exactly 0.5. Your code should also work with vectors and
matrices. For a matrix, your
